.SH NAME
bcharge \- program to set BlackBerry handhelds to 500mA
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bcharge
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBbcharge\fP is a program that sends a special handshake to all BlackBerry
devices it finds on the USB bus.  This handshake causes the device to reset
itself, and then request 500mA instead of the usual 100mA.  This allows
proper charging on Linux.
.PP
It is safe to run this command multiple times, as it only changes devices
that are not already set to 500mA.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-o
For Blackberry Pearl devices, using this switch causes bcharge to set the
Product ID to 0001.  Otherwise, the default is to use Product ID 0004.
When the Pearl is in 0004 mode, two USB interfaces are presented:
one for database access and one for mass storage.  In 0001 mode, only
the database access is available.

Before bcharge is run, the Pearl shows up with a Product ID of 0006,
which only gives mass storage functionality.  You must run bcharge
for the Pearl before using btool.
