.SH NAME
.B btool
\- Barry Project's program to interface with BlackBerry handheld
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B btool 
[-c dn][-d db[-r#][-R#]-D#]][-h][-l][-p pin][-s db -f file][-t][-v][-X]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B btool
is a very early version of a program that communicates with a
BlackBerry device over USB; there is no intention to support ancient
serial-port BlackBerries.
Since the protocols used by BlackBerry are not documented 
by the manufacturer Research In Motion, this program is 
experimental and you \fBuse at own risk\fP. 
Be sure your device is backed up by another program
if it contains important data.
.PP
The -l option lists attached devices.
.PP
The -d option loads a database from the device and displays it to the screen.
.PP
The -s option saves a database to the device from the named file.
.PP
Use -h for description of the other options.

to help with the project.
