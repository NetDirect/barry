.SH NAME
.B bjavaloader
\- Barry Project's program to manage BlackBerry applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bjavaloader
[-f][-h][-s][-p pin][-P pass][-v][dir|load|erase|screenshot|settime]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B bjavaloader
is a tool for loading, listing, and deleting applications on a BlackBerry
device.  It has a few other features as well, not pertaining to application
management.  The command syntax is intentionally similar to the Windows
program 'javaloader.exe' provided by Research In Motion, in order
to make it easy to use the same build scripts on Linux and Windows.

Used with the 'erase' command to force the erasure of an application
that is currently in use in the device.  Experimental.
