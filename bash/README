Barry bash autocompletion
========================

The scripts in this directory are programmable
completion functions for barry utils used in bash.
To use them, simply copy the files in this directory
except this README file to:
	/etc/bash_completion.d/

And to load manually, run the following command:
	$ . /etc/bash_completion

Programmable completion is for bash 3+ but is backwards
compatiable with bash 2.05b.
