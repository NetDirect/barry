#
# Ideally, the evolution source path autodetection routines would
# load libebook and libecal dynamically, so that dependencies would
# not force the inclusion of evolution-data-server and friends.
#
# But there are two problems with that, which need to be
# cracked first:
#
#     - the glib major version numbers, according to the .so
#       files, are not consistent between distros
#     - when used dynamically, in a program that is not otherwise
#       linked to glib, it can segfault... and it seems to get
#       funky somewhere inside glib itself... so I'm guessing that
#       the library is not being initialized properly :-(
#
# All this means that general compilations of barrydesktop will
# need evolution-data-server and friends linked in.  It is possible
# to compile without by supplying --without-evolution on the configure
# command line, but then you risk getting a weak auto-detection
# of data sources in newer versions of evolution.  If your data
# sources are located in paths like this:
#
#      file:///home/cdfrey/.evolution/addressbook/local/system
#
# then it is safe to disable evolution for the barrydesktop compile.
#
# Otherwise, if your version of evolution is new, and uses funkier names,
# or uses local:system, or puts its files under ~/.config, then
# build --with-evolution and link against it.
