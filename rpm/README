This SPEC file, barry-bcharge.spec, will create a complete standalone RPM
for just the bcharge utility out of the official barry tarball.

Download the barry-0.7 tarball to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES and this SPEC file
to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS, then build it like so:

cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
rpmbuild -ba barry-bcharge.spec

(you do *not* have to be root to build - this RPM will build as a non-root
user, just make sure the permissions on /usr/src/redhat/* are OK for your
non-root user)

The resultant RPM will be called something akin to
barry-bcharge-0.7-1.i386.rpm; it will contain the binary, udev rules,
manpage and doc files. It must be installed as root.

If this is the first time installing it or the udev rules, a reboot is
recommended to get the udev rules working correctly. If you have already
installed the udev rules before, a reboot is not needed.
