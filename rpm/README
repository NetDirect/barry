This SPEC file, barry-bcharge.spec, will create a complete standalone RPM
for just the bcharge utility out of the official barry tarball.

NOTE: At this time it requires SF.net patch #1663986, the udev rules patch
to support the newer 8100/8800 devices.

Download the udev rules patch and barry-0.6 tarball to
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES and this SPEC file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS, then
build it like so:

cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/
rpmbuild -ba barry-bcharge.spec

(you do *not* have to be root to build - this RPM will build as a non-root
user, just make sure the permissions on /usr/src/redhat/* are OK for your
non-root user)

The resultant RPM will be called something akin to
barry-bcharge-0.6-1.i386.rpm; it will contain the binary, udev rules,
manpage and doc files. It must be installed as root.

If this is the first time installing it or the udev rules, a reboot is
recommended to get the udev rules working correctly. If you have already
installed the udev rules before a reboot is not needed.
