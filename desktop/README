This is the Desktop sub-project of the Barry project.  You will need the
Barry library compiled and installed to use this.  This directory
contains a fully standalone build tree, but can optionally be built
automatically when you build Barry if you use the --enable-desktop
configure option.

See doc/www/index.html for more documentation.
