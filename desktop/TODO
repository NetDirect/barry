Feature TODO List:
==================
- make it possible to turn debug output on and off in the library on the fly
- add general desktop configuration class, so you can save things like
	whether debug should be on or off... perhaps this should be a global
	barry configuration, so that the gui can determine whether all
	programs are verbose or not, etc.
- add Barry logo (top left) which, if clicked, shows a general system menu
	containing items like:
	- enable / disable USB debug logging
	- direct logging to a file
	- reset current device, wait, and rescan
- add netdirect logo and if clicked, open browser to http://netdirect.ca/barry
- perhaps make mouse change its cursor when over these logos
- move some of the ~/.barry/backup/PIN/config code into the library,
	into Probe, and perhaps a class to manage this data
- add code to scan the bus when desktop opens, and list devices in a
	dropdown combobox in the bottom right corner
- launch the BarryBackup GUI from the first button, and wait for its
	exit, and don't let the backup button work if the GUI is still
	running... let the others work though(?)
