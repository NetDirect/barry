Feature TODO List:
==================
- menu item: direct logging to a file
- add code to scan the bus when desktop opens, and list devices in a
	dropdown combobox in the bottom right corner
- menu item: reset current device, wait, and rescan
- launch the BarryBackup GUI from the first button, and wait for its
	exit, and don't let the backup button work if the GUI is still
	running... let the others work though(?)
- take a screenshot of the active device and display it in the empty
	space on the main screen (to show battery level, etc)
- make the images/ directory installable, like gui/ .glade files
- load the images/ from installed directory, instead of hard coded ../

Sync:
-----
- add a feature that blanks the BlackBerry for a clean one-way sync...
	be sure to warn the user strenuously, that for 0.22 the
	Address Book and Calendar will be wiped, and for 0.4x the
	Address Book, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks will be wiped
	- test 0.4x, and see if it is possible to do a clean one-way
		sync without deleting all 4 databases... on 0.22 this
		seems to cause opensync to go into a stupendously long
		busy loop... maybe 0.4x is better
