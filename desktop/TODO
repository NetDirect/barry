Feature TODO List:
==================
- menu item: reset current device, wait, and rescan
- make the images/ directory installable, like gui/ .glade files
- load the images/ from installed directory, instead of hard coded ../

Sync:
-----
- when pressing the Sync button, if a device is selected that is not
	yet configured, ask the user if they want to configure or cancel,
	and let them jump directly into the configure mode
- add an "Application(s)" column to the device list, so users can see
	at a glance which apps are syncable
- refactor the 'evolution --force-shutdown' execute call, so it is easily
	useable for configuration and syncing
- add a listctrl, supporting multiple selection of devices, and
	remember which *devices* (PIN numbers) are selected, and
	re-select them the next time Sync opens... this gets around
	the lack of support in wxWidgets for a checkbox in the listctrl,
	to select which device(s) to sync with the Sync Now button
- add a feature that blanks the BlackBerry for a clean one-way sync...
	be sure to warn the user strenuously, that for 0.22 the
	Address Book and Calendar will be wiped, and for 0.4x the
	Address Book, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks will be wiped
	- test 0.4x, and see if it is possible to do a clean one-way
		sync without deleting all 4 databases... on 0.22 this
		seems to cause opensync to go into a stupendously long
		busy loop... maybe 0.4x is better

Wishlist TODO List:
===================
- menu item: direct logging to a file
	- or, log to a stringstream... this can always be added later if
		grabbing the verbose data from stderr is not enough
