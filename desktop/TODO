Feature TODO List:
==================
- consider moving the config file out of ~/.barry/backup/PIN and into
	~/.barry/PIN, but leave ~/.barry/backup for the data
- add Barry logo (top left) which, if clicked, shows a general system menu
	containing items like:
	- enable / disable USB debug logging
	- direct logging to a file
	- reset current device, wait, and rescan
- add netdirect logo and if clicked, open browser to http://netdirect.ca/barry
- perhaps make mouse change its cursor when over these logos
- move some of the ~/.barry/backup/PIN/config code into the library,
	into Probe, and perhaps a class to manage this data
- add code to scan the bus when desktop opens, and list devices in a
	dropdown combobox in the bottom right corner
- launch the BarryBackup GUI from the first button, and wait for its
	exit, and don't let the backup button work if the GUI is still
	running... let the others work though(?)
- take a screenshot of the active device and display it in the empty
	space on the main screen (to show battery level, etc)
- make the images/ directory installable, like gui/ .glade files
- load the images/ from installed directory, instead of hard coded ../
