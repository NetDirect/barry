Release TODO List:
==================
- package barrydesktop so that all .o files are included, to comply with
	the LGPL (wxWidgets)

Feature TODO List:
==================
- menu item: reset current device, wait, and rescan

Sync:
-----
- test 0.4x, and see if it is possible to do a clean one-way
	sync without deleting all 4 databases... on 0.22 this
	seems to cause opensync to go into a stupendously long
	busy loop... maybe 0.4x is better
- 0.4x has a CheckSummary state, that shows what changes are going
	to happen just before the sync happens... in the command line
	version, this is shown in a text table... should create a dialog
	for the user to approve first... perhaps make this a config
	option, so that the user doesn't have to confirm on each
	sync if he doesn't want to

Wishlist TODO List:
===================
- menu item: direct logging to a file
	- or, log to a stringstream... this can always be added later if
		grabbing the verbose data from stderr is not enough
- hook into HAL or inotify or udev somehow, to automatically detect when
	a new device has been unplugged or plugged in, and do a usb scan
	immediately, and update the lists, in the main screen, and in sync
- add timer to screenshot, so it updates every second
