Feature TODO List:
==================
- menu item: reset current device, wait, and rescan

Sync:
-----
- add support for re-starting the config, to make one side clean and the
	other side authoritative, to recover from slow-syncs
- add code to detect slow-syncs, in the jail and the server, so that
	slow-syncs on 0.22 never actually run
- add a "Zap Config" button that zaps the current opensync config for
	the current device, and recreates it automatically, and warns
	the user, and recommends that the user delete one side of the
	sync... either all the app data or all the blackberry data...
	and make it easy to zap the blackberry data
	- add a feature that blanks the BlackBerry for a clean one-way sync...
		be sure to warn the user strenuously, that for 0.22 the
		Address Book and Calendar will be wiped, and for 0.4x the
		Address Book, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks will be wiped
		- test 0.4x, and see if it is possible to do a clean one-way
			sync without deleting all 4 databases... on 0.22 this
			seems to cause opensync to go into a stupendously long
			busy loop... maybe 0.4x is better
- add support for parsing the XML conflict data from opensync
- add a "Run App" button in the sync status window, in case of bad sync?
- when pressing the Sync button, if a device is selected that is not
	yet configured, ask the user if they want to configure or cancel,
	and let them jump directly into the configure mode

Wishlist TODO List:
===================
- menu item: direct logging to a file
	- or, log to a stringstream... this can always be added later if
		grabbing the verbose data from stderr is not enough
