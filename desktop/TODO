Release TODO List:
==================
- package barrydesktop so that all .o files are included, to comply with
	the LGPL (wxWidgets)

Feature TODO List:
==================
- menu item: reset current device, wait, and rescan

Sync:
-----
- add support for xml path mapping, (see horrendous conflict dialog for
	calendar items)
	- contact key info: name, company, phone number, email
	- calendar key info: summary, dates, location, description
- test 0.4x, and see if it is possible to do a clean one-way
	sync without deleting all 4 databases... on 0.22 this
	seems to cause opensync to go into a stupendously long
	busy loop... maybe 0.4x is better

Wishlist TODO List:
===================
- menu item: direct logging to a file
	- or, log to a stringstream... this can always be added later if
		grabbing the verbose data from stderr is not enough
