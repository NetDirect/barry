Feature TODO List:
==================
- menu item: reset current device, wait, and rescan

Sync:
-----
- add a "Run App" button on the main sync list screen that runs the
	application of the currently selected device
- add a "Zap Config" button that zaps the current opensync config for
	the current device, and recreates it automatically, and warns
	the user, and recommends that the user delete one side of the
	sync... either all the app data or all the blackberry data...
	and make it easy to zap the blackberry data
- add support for parsing the XML conflict data from opensync
- start thinking about sync status window, and sync conflict resolution
- when pressing the Sync button, if a device is selected that is not
	yet configured, ask the user if they want to configure or cancel,
	and let them jump directly into the configure mode
- add a listctrl, supporting multiple selection of devices, and
	remember which *devices* (PIN numbers) are selected, and
	re-select them the next time Sync opens... this gets around
	the lack of support in wxWidgets for a checkbox in the listctrl,
	to select which device(s) to sync with the Sync Now button
- add a feature that blanks the BlackBerry for a clean one-way sync...
	be sure to warn the user strenuously, that for 0.22 the
	Address Book and Calendar will be wiped, and for 0.4x the
	Address Book, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks will be wiped
	- test 0.4x, and see if it is possible to do a clean one-way
		sync without deleting all 4 databases... on 0.22 this
		seems to cause opensync to go into a stupendously long
		busy loop... maybe 0.4x is better

Wishlist TODO List:
===================
- menu item: direct logging to a file
	- or, log to a stringstream... this can always be added later if
		grabbing the verbose data from stderr is not enough
