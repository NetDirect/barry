Tasks database self-corrupts on many devices
--------------------------------------------
	If you extract a Tasks record, and then write it back via
	SetRecordByIndex(), on many devices that I tested, it ends up
	corrupting the record on the device, and the GUI on the device
	appears messed up.  (It shows the first few fields twice)
	Such a corrupt record also loses the due date.

	This appears to be a bug in the device firmware.

	The workaround, when working with the Tasks database, is to
	first DeleteByIndex() and then AddRecord() via the Desktop mode class,
	using the same record ID.  This works, but is unfortunately
	cumbersome.

	See the Desktop GUI and the opensync plugins for examples of this
	workaround.

	Ideally, we should test a Tasks sync on Windows, and see how
	the Windows software handles this.  There may be some protocol
	changes that will be needed in future Barry versions.
