No support for BlackBerry Z10 and newer devices
-----------------------------------------------
	I don't have one of these devices, and from what I understand,
	the protocol is completely different.  User reports
	would be appreciated.


Tasks database self-corrupts on many devices
--------------------------------------------
	If you extract a Tasks record, and then write it back via
	SetRecordByIndex(), on many devices that I tested, it ends up
	corrupting the record on the device, and the GUI on the device
	appears messed up.  (It shows the first few fields twice)
	Such a corrupt record also loses the due date.

	This appears to be a bug in the device firmware.

	The workaround, when working with the Tasks database, is to
	first DeleteByIndex() and then AddRecord() via the Desktop mode class,
	using the same record ID.  This works, but is unfortunately
	cumbersome.

	See the Desktop GUI and the opensync plugins for examples of this
	workaround.

	Ideally, we should test a Tasks sync on Windows, and see how
	the Windows software handles this.  There may be some protocol
	changes that will be needed in future Barry versions.


Dates before 2007/01/01 use modern DST rules
--------------------------------------------
	This is a device firmware issue.  Most devices that I've tested
	use modern DST rules (i.e. DST begins second Sunday in March)
	for all dates, even though these new rules only came into effect
	in 2007.  So dates in 2006 and earlier have a window of innaccuracy,
	since dates are given to Barry in UTC, converted to time_t, and most
	computer systems will then convert that time_t to local time using
	the old DST rules, and be an hour off.

	Barry does nothing to workaround this bug, since most dates
	are used in Calendar and Task apps, which usually only matter
	for modern dates.  In other words, you use the Task and Calendar
	apps to remind yourself of future appointments, not the past.
	This appears to be the logic that RIM used as well, since the
	device seems to only have one DST rule, and doesn't care about
	historical rules.
