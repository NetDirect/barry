This describes the udev files in this directory and what they are used for:


10-blackberry.rules
10-blackberry.rules.Debian

	udev rules for running bcharge when you plugin your Blackberry.
	Creates symlinks as well.

	The .Debian file is for Debian Etch, and sets the permissions
	as well.  This should be the only file you need for Debian Etch.


10-blackberry.perms

	For RedHat/Fedora systems, this file goes into:

		/etc/security/console.perms.d/

	It will dynamically give ownership of the /dev/bb-* (well, the
	target of those symlinks) to the logged in console or xconsole
	user. The idea was taken from this page:

	http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Griffin_PowerMate_with_UDEV_and_Kernel_2.6.x

	Search for 'New alternative'.


99-barry-perms

	For systems that don't support /etc/security/console.perms.d/,
	this udev script utilizes a special group "barry" and sets
	the devices to mode "0660".

	You will need to create a "barry" group on your system to use this.
