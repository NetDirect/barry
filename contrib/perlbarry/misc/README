deipd:         deconstructs an <BASENAME>.ipd file into individual database
               files of format <BASENAME>/<DB>.deipd, with file
               <BASENAME>/<BASENAME>.info containing a list of the
               databases.

reipd:         reconstructs an .ipd file to <BASENAME>.ipd2. Argument to
               reipd is the directory containing the .deipd files, or the
               <BASENAME>.info file. No argument needed if in the directory
               containing these files. This will recreate the original .ipd
               file byte-for-byte if the data was unchanged. Alternatively,
               .deipd files can be given on the command line, with output to
               "new.ipd2".

backup:        backs up each DB in phone, or each DB given on command line,
               to file <DB>/<RECORD> (in binary format). data is same as
               barrybackup data, but with a 15 byte header (and not
               tar-gzipped).

convert-dumps: converts "btool -n -d <DBNAME>" output, or .dump files from
               "dump-simple", into individual binary files.

dump-simple:   backs up each DB in phone to file <DB>.dump

split-jpeg:    takes resulting files of "convert-dumps Content_Store" and
               outputs any jpeg files into current directory, as well as
               header into a separate file.  the file "Content_Store" is
               created by "btool -d 'Content Store' > Content_Store".
