These are the three most useful programs. See misc/ for more.
All development and testing done with barry-0.12.

NOTE: btool must be patched for this to work properly. In the parent
directory of btool-0.12, do "patch -p 0 < [PATH_TO]/btool.patch".

ipd2tgz:       converts file <BASENAME>.ipd to <BASENAME>.tar.gz, in the
               format of barrybackup.

barrybkup:     backs up each DB in phone, or each DB given on command line,
               to file ~/.barry/backup/<PIN>/<PIN>-<DATE>-<TIME>.tar.gz
               (identical output as the barrybackup GUI). Useful for
               automating backups which can be restored with the GUI
               barrybackup. REQUIRES patched btool.
