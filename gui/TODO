Required functionality:
	+ backup
	+ restore
	- edit


- add option in config to always pop up a database selection box
	when pressing Backup or Restore buttons, so they can be
	confirmed each time instead of relying on the config
- add message and "continue/stop" choice for restores, if the protocol
	side throws an error... should always try to restore everything
	the user asks for, not stop half way through if the device
	doesn't like a particular database
- add an "ignore these errors" for the case when restoring
	causes numerous errors that you don't care about
- allow temporary overriding of backup destination by letting user
	type in the PIN field... as soon as the user types something,
	change the label to "Backup filename:" or something, and
	let user type in full path name.  If no '/' chars exist in user's
	filename, then assume config default path, and open a
	Save... file chooser box in that directory.  If there are '/'
	chars in the filename, attempt to chdir() there and open
	Save... file chooser there.
- add option in config dialog to set a different default backup
	directory instead of ~/.barry/backup/<pin>/
- add code to detect when user is trying to quit or close window with X
	while a backup/restore is still running and give them the
	option to shutdown thread and really quit or cancel and keep going.
- add a Cancel button to stop a backup or restore
- find out why the following give errors on restore:
	- Browser Bookmarks
	- Browser Channels(?)
	- Browser Folders
	- Browser Options
	- Browser Urls
	- Content Store
	- Default Service Selector
	- Handheld Agent
	- Messages
	- Searches
	- Service Book
	- Also, the following restore ok, but end up different
		on the next backup than the first... why?
		- KeyStoreManager
		- Profiles
		- Quick Contacts
		- Random Pool
	- See the two backup tar.gz files in gui/src/workdata/
	- After a Windows restore, there are still differences in
		the following databases:
		- Browser Options
		- Content Store
		- Handheld Agent
		- KeyStoreManager
		- Messages
		- Profiles
		- Quick Contacts
		- Random Pool
		- Service Book
	- Perhaps the databases that Windows can't even restore fully should
		be removed from the restore list by default.  There are
		still databases that Windows seems able to restore that
		we can't though, such as most of the Browser* databases.
