This is the GUI sub-project of the Barry project.  You will need the
Barry library compiled and installed to use this.  This directory
contains a fully standalone build tree, and is not built automatically
when you build Barry.



Library Dependencies:
---------------------

You will need the following packages installed on your system, including
any dev or devel packages that come along with them: (all of these
packages are easily available on Debian stable... your mileage may vary
on other distros)

	pkg-config		Used by the configure scripts
	gtkmm 2.4		C++ GTK+ wrapper library
	glademm 2.4		C++ glade wrapper library
	glibmm 2.4		C++ glib wrapper library
	libusb 0.1.x		USB interface library
	libtar 1.2.x		TAR file library
	zlib			compression library

And of course:

	libbarry 0.x		In the same tarball as this code.

If you've installed Barry in a non-standard spot, use something like the
following:

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/cdfrey/Barry/lib/pkgconfig"
	./configure --prefix=/home/cdfrey/Barry



Dependency packages for common distributions:
---------------------------------------------
The following is a list of packages you'll need to install to build the GUI,
if you are using one of the below common distributions.  Other distributions
should have similar package names.

	Fedora 5 and 6:
	---------------
	Use the yum package manager to install the following:

		pkgconfig
		libtar  (libtar-devel on Fedora 6)
		libusb-devel
		gtkmm24-devel
		glibmm24-devel
		zlib-devel

	Debian stable:

		pkg-config
