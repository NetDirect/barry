This is the GUI sub-project of the Barry project.  You will need the
Barry library compiled and installed to use this.  This directory
contains a fully standalone build tree, and is not built automatically
when you build Barry.

You will need the following packages installed on your system, including
any dev or devel packages that come along with them: (all of these
packages are easily available on Debian stable... your mileage may vary
on other distros)

	pkg-config		Used by the configure scripts
	gtkmm 2.4		C++ GTK+ wrapper library
	glademm 2.4		C++ glade wrapper library
	glibmm 2.4		C++ glib wrapper library
	libusb 0.1.x		USB interface library
	libtar 1.2.x		TAR file library
	zlib			compression library

And of course:

	libbarry 0.x		In the same tarball as this code.

If you've installed Barry in a non-standard spot, use something like the
following:

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/cdfrey/Barry/lib/pkgconfig"
	./configure --prefix=/home/cdfrey/Barry


And if you have any trouble, please send mail to the mailing list and
ask for help!
