This directory contains sample options files for pppd, as well as their
associated chatscript files.  They are named for the various Blackberry
vendors that have different connect sequences for tethered modems.

Each file is tagged with the name "barry" as well, so they can be
installed in /etc/ppp/peers someday, to make all this automated
and easy.

It is a good idea to review these options files to make sure they
suit your system.  Particularly the defaultroute options, and their
various security implications.  You may wish to read the following URLs
