Barry is primarily intended to be a library, for any application to
access Blackberry devices.  There will be an OpenSync module built
on top of this, plus some command line utilities, and possibly a GUI,
but initially Barry is a library, and must be versioned accordingly.

Additional applications built on top of Barry may be versioned separately.

Most operating systems can handle two library version numbers: major.minor.
They use these numbers to determine which library is compatible
and most recent.

Therefore Barry will be versioned the same way, the major version
number indicating a backward incompatible change to the library.


Version Numbering Plan:
-----------------------

	Alpha development will occur on major version 0, incrementing the
	minor version only until stability is reached.
	
	When the 0.x series is stable, as a special case, the highest
	stable 0.x version will be released as version 1.00.  User-
	readable version strings in the library and applications will
	be changed to 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 1.05, etc, but the library
	version in src/Makefile.am will stay on the 0.x series.
	
	Bugfix releases for this stable series will continue from there,
	using 1.01 in user strings, and 0.x in the src/Makefile.am.

	A new development branch will be started with the version 1.50,
	and both src/Makefile.am and the user strings will match again.

	From then on, development will continue on odd numbered major
	versions with incompatible changes allowed.  When stable, version
	1.x will become 2.0, and the 3.x branch will be opened.

Due to limitations in remaining portable across as many operating systems
as possible, Barry will discontinue its 3-number version scheme as of
version 0.4.
