Subject: CVS commit policy

Hi folks,

For those of you sending patches, this is probably good to know:

In order to track copyrights properly, so I can go back in the history
and see who sent what patch, I try, whenever possible, to commit
the *exact* patch I receive, even if it temporarily breaks the tree,
or if there are things I don't agree with and plan to change later.

For these commits, I use the words "applied patch from X" in the Changelog
and the CVS commit message.  And then I change whatever I think needs
changing, and commit that later.

In this way, history is preserved, in case it is needed down the road.

Also, if you see your raw patch committed, there may be a followup
commit coming after.  Just to be aware of.

And again, a huge thank you to everyone who has sent patches!
If you have sent a patch and didn't get into the AUTHORS file, or
are unhappy with what is there (perhaps an email address change,
or whatever) just let me know.

- Chris
