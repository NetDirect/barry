<div class='pageHeader'>Backing up your BlackBerry Data</div><img src='nothing.jpg' width='100%' height='5' alt=''><br><div class='linearNav'>

<div class="subHeader">Introduction</div>
<p>Backups are currently performed using the Barry Backup GUI program, located
in the gui/ directory of the source tarball.  Instructions for building the
GUI can be found on the <a href="install.html">Install</a>
 and
<a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>
 pages.</p>


<div class="subHeader">GTK+ Themes</div>
<p>The Barry Backup GUI program is written using the GTK+ library.  If you
do not use the Gnome desktop, then the default theme for GTK+ applications
often looks terrible.</p>

<p>Themes can be chosen for GTK+ apps without Gnome's settings
or daemons interfering with your desktop of choice.</p>

<p>Search under the /usr/share/themes directory for 'gtkrc' files.  Pick
the one you like best, and then include it by reference in your .gtkrc-2.0
config file in your home directory.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to use the GTK+ Clearlooks theme.
Your .gtkrc-2.0 file would contain:</p>

<pre>
	include "/usr/share/themes/Clearlooks/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
</pre>


<div class="subHeader">Main Screen</div>

<p>When Backup starts, it scans the USB bus for all the Blackberry devices
it can find and lists them in the main screen.  The first device listed
is automatically connected and highlighted.</p>

<p>You can connect to different devices on the fly by selecting the
desired device in the list.  The currently highlighted device determines
what device the buttons to the right will operate on.</p>

<p>When connecting to a device for the first time, you are prompted to
give the device a name.  This will be linked to the device's PIN number
for easy identification later.</p>

<p>The main screen presents you with a number of options.</p>

<div class="subHeader">Backup Button</div>
<p>The Backup button initiates the backup process for the currently selected
device.  Multiple backups and restores can be run at once.</p>

<p>When backing up your device, your data is saved by default in a
compressed tar file in your home directory, under ~/.barry, organized by
PIN number.  Each tar backup file is given a timestamp in its filename.
The destination directory can be changed per device, using the Config...
button.</p>

<p>When the backup starts, you are prompted to give the backup an optional
name.  If you specify a name, it will be used as part of the tar filename.</p>



<div class="subHeader">Restore Button</div>
<p>Pressing the Restore button will show a File Open dialog, pointing
to your ~/.barry directory, for the current device PIN.</p>

<img src="restore.png"/>
<p>You are not limited to the tar files in this directory, nor are you
limited to backup files from the same device.  You can use this tool
to copy data from one device to another.</p>

<p>The restore is governed by your current configuration, which determines
what databases are restored.  Any database that is restored will be
completely erased before the backup data is re-written.  If the source
backup file contains no data for that database, then the database
will merely be erased.</p>

<p>There are some databases that are read-only on the BlackBerry.
In addition, if your device is connected to a BES, you may not be
able to restore your data.  If you get errors when trying to
restore a certain read-only database, disable that database in
the Restore Configuration dialog, as described below.</p>



<div class="subHeader">Config Button</div>
<p>Pressing the Config button opens the config options dialog as shown
below.</p>

<img src="config.png"/>
<p>You can rename your device here, set a different backup target directory,
and select whether backups should have labels or not.  If this checkbox
is selected, you will be prompted for an optional label each time you
create a new backup.</p>

<img src="label.png"/>
<p>Both backup and restore operations have their own database filters
which can be configured here.  For the backup filter, only the enabled
databases will be saved.  For the restore filter, only the enabled
databases will be restored, even if the backup file contains more data.</p>

<p>Each filter configure button provides essentially the same dialog,
containing a list of databases available on your device, as well as
checkboxes to enable them.</p>

<img src="config-backup.png"/>
<p>This configuration is saved per device PIN.  If you backup a different
device, you will need to configure its backup strategy again.  You can only
change the configuration for the current device with these dialogs.</p>



<div class="subHeader">Disconnect Buttons</div>
<p>The Disconnect and Disconnect All buttons let you escape the device's
Desktop mode while keeping the program running.  It is possible to disconnect
during a backup or restore, but this may leave your device data in an
unknown state.</p>

<div class="subHeader">Rescan Button</div>
<p>This button refreshes the device list, which is useful when a new device
has been plugged in.</p>
