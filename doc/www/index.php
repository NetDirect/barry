<div class="subHeader">Overview</div>

<p>Linux users who also use a BlackBerry &trade; now have an option for
managing their BlackBerry directly from Linux.</p>

<p>Barry is an Open Source Linux application that will allow synchronization,
backup, restore and program management for BlackBerry &trade; devices.
You can find the source code at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/barry/">Sourceforge project page</a>
</p>
