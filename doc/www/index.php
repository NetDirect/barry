<div class="subHeader">Overview</div>

<p>Linux users who also use a BlackBerry &trade; now have an option for
managing their BlackBerry directly from Linux.</p>

<p>Barry is an Open Source Linux application that will allow synchronization,
backup, restore and program management for BlackBerry &trade; devices.
You can find the source code at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/barry/">Sourceforge project page</a>

<div class="subHeader">Help Wanted</div>

<p>We can always use help in developing extra features.
There are dozens of databases that need to be documented and coded for.
If you have a BlackBerry &trade; device and are interested in helping decipher
data, we have a <? createLink("hacking", "barry hacking document"); ?> that will
help you.

<p>We are also looking for help in many areas.
We need a GUI developer, if you are a Python guru and want to help dig in.
