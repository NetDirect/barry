This website code is part of a larger system, and hence the funny
looking PHP syntax.  It is coded this way in order to easily
plugin to that system, but the content is included in this
tarball so at least the docs are available.

Some simple function stubs are provided to turn this into static
web pages if you have PHP installed.  Just run static.sh,
then point your browser at the resulting index.html.
