<p>The Browse mode screen is shown below:

<p>
<center>
<? createImageEx("desktop-browse.png", 'width="480" height="352" alt="Barry Desktop browse screen"'); ?>
</center>

<p>This screen provides an interface to Add, Copy, Edit, Delete, Import,
and Export various database records.

<p>By default, only the databases that Barry recognizes are shown in the
list on the left, but by clicking the Show All Databases checkbox, this
list will expand to include all available databases.

<p>For the Address Book, Calendar, Memos, and Tasks databases, it is possible
to edit the records directly by double clicking on them, or pressing the
Edit button.

<p>The Import button supports importing a vCard or iCalendar record, such as
those attached to email by some mail clients.  The Export button does the
reverse.

<p>For the rest of the databases which do not have edit dialogs available,
it is only possible to use the Delete button.
