<div class='pageHeader'>Using your BlackBerry as a USB Modem</div><img src='nothing.jpg' width='100%' height='5' alt=''><br><div class='linearNav'>




<div class="subHeader">Introduction</div>

<p>The Blackberry has the ability to act like a Hayes compatible modem,
complete with AT commands.</p>

<p>In order to make use of this feature you will need the Barry command line
tools installed on your system.  See the <a href="install.html">Install</a>
page for more details.</p>

<p>You will need three components to connect to the internet:
<ul>
	<li> a working Barry install, version 0.13 or later </li>
	<li> a working pppd and matching kernel </li>
	<li> an options file and chatscript for your Blackberry provider </li>
</ul>
</p>


<div class="subHeader">If You Installed Barry's Binary Packages...</div>

<p>If you installed Barry's binary packages, specifically barry-util,
then default ppp options and chat scripts are installed automatically
for you.  Currently there are scripts available for the following
providers:
<ul>
	<li> O2 Ireland </li>
	<li> Rogers </li>
	<li> Sprint </li>
	<li> T-Mobile US </li>
	<li> Verizon </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For example, to run the default Rogers connection script, use the
following command as root:</p>
<pre>
	pppd call barry-rogers
</pre>

<p>If none of the default script work, see the Troubleshooting section
below.</p>


<div class="subHeader">If You Installed Barry From Source...</div>

<p><b>Configuring PPPD</b></p>

<p>Sample configurations are provided in the source tarball, and if you are
using a binary package, they should already be installed for you under
/etc/ppp/peers and (depending on your system) /etc/chatscripts.</p>

<p>Copy the desired options file to /etc/ppp/peers and edit the file,
making sure that the paths are referencing the correct files.
<ul>
	<li> <b>pty</b> - must point to the location you installed Barry's
			pppob program. </li>
	<li> <b>connect</b> - must use the correct chatscript </li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><b>Establishing a Connection</b></p>

<p>If you named your options file "barry-rogers", then to connect to the
internet, run:</p>
<pre>
	pppd call barry-rogers
</pre>

<p>Some systems may provide wrapper scripts for running pppd.  For example,
Debian uses "pon" and "poff".</p>



<div class="subHeader">If Your Device Needs a Password...</div>

<p>If your device requires a password, you can specify this on the <b>pppob</b>
command line.  For example, if you are using the <i>barry-rogers</i>
PPP script, edit your /etc/ppp/peers/barry-rogers file, so that the
<b>pty</b> option says something like this:
</p>
<pre>
	pty "/usr/sbin/pppob -P password"
</pre>


<div class="subHeader">Testing Your Connection</div>

<p>PPP will display some messages on stdout as it connects.  On success,
you should see IP address negotiation and the resulting IP address for your
machine.  PPP will then just wait for network activity.</p>

<p>When testing to see if this works, use your web browser.  The usual
method of using <b>ping</b> does not work reliably, and some providers
may have this blocked.</p>

<p>Check your routing table to make sure that the new default gateway
is there.</p>
<pre>
	/sbin/route -n
</pre>


<div class="subHeader">Security Concerns</div>

<p>Depending on your provider, you may or may not have a firewall installed
when you connect to the internet through a tethered modem.  Keep an eye on
your open ports, and remember that connecting to the internet this way
may not be the same as the network you are used to.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that if your system is configured to forward packets
and you have pppd setup to replace your current default route, and you
are still connected to an internal network (say, via ethernet), this could
allow outside connections to be routed to your internal network.  The
default pppd options files installed by Barry do not use the
<b>replacedefaultroute</b> setting for this reason.  Contact your
network administrator for assistance on configuring your mobile
network setups.</p>



<div class="subHeader">Troubleshooting</div>

<p>Some devices don't respond to the PPP commands at first, but after
the battery is removed and reinserted, modem functionality works.  This is
likely due to the protocol not being completely understood, but resetting
the device in this manner is enough of a workaround to get it working.</p>

<p>If you still run into trouble, the first task is to increase debug output
and to log it.  PPPD supports increased logging if you add the following
lines to the options file:</p>
<pre>
	debug
	nodetach
</pre>

<p>Barry's <b>pppob</b> program also supports verbose protocol logging.
Change your options file and edit the pppob command line.  For example,
if your pppob is installed in /usr/sbin, set the <b>pty</b> option to:</p>

<pre>
	pty "/usr/sbin/pppob -l /tmp/pppob.log -v"
</pre>

<p>Be sure to remove these options once you have your connection working,
as the above causes your entire internet traffic to be logged to the
output file.</p>

<p>If your provider is not yet supported by the sample options files,
you will need to do a little digging on your own.  If you are able to
tether your Blackberry using a Windows system, you can duplicate the
login information in your chat script.</p>

<p>You may also find example configurations for your provider on the
various Blackberry forums available online.</p>

<p>If you are still having trouble, please send an email to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=153722">mailing list</a>,
including:
<ul>
	<li> the version of Barry you are using </li>
	<li> the output from pppd </li>
	<li> the log output from pppob </li>
	<li> the ppp options file and chatscript you used </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The logs from pppob can be fairly large, so limit the size to a single
run.</p>
