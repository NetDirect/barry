You should not need a SIM card, I never have.

On your BlackBerry, go to Options > Advanced Options > Sim Card.

At that screen type MEPD on your keyboard. A new menu will pop up.

Look for Network in the list.


If your device is "unlocked", it should say Disabled or Inactive. If it
says Active, it's still locked to that carrier.
