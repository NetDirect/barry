The Barry library throws two types of exceptions:

	Usb::UsbError - derived from std::runtime_error
		All specific USB error exceptions will be derived from
		this class.  This is currently the only class used, and
		only thrown in the usbwrap.{h,cc} code.


	Barry::BError - derived from std::runtime_error
		All specific Barry error exceptions will be derived from
		this class.  This is currently the only class used, and
		can be thrown from anywhere inside Barry.



There is also the remote possibility that there will be memory exceptions
from a call to 'new'.  In that case, std::bad_alloc will be thrown
by the standard C++ libraries.  Barry does not catch these errors.

All of the above exceptions are derived from std::exception, so they
can all be caught in one statement for the efficient and lazy. :-)
