  To run the application, launch the binary in the "bin" directory

  $ cd bin
  $ ./bjdwp


4. Usage

4.1 Command line

  1°) Plug your BlackBerry device

  2°) Run bjdwp wrapper 

    $ bjdwp localhost 8000

  3°) Run JDB

    $ jdb -connect com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:hostname=localhost,port=8000

      or

    $ jdb -attach localhost:8080
