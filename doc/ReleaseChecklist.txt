A note on the tags in Barry's git repository:
---------------------------------------------
Each release will now have at least 3 tags.  For example, if releasing
version 0.14, the tags will be:

	barry-0.14		Tag on master branch, signifying the
				development point that the release occured
	barry-0.14.tar.bz2	Contains the exact contents of the
				full tar.bz2 release tarball.  If you
				look far enough in the history logs, you will
				find the barry-0.14 tag.
	barry_0.14.orig.tar.gz	Contains the exact contents of the debian
				source package tarball.  Again, barry-0.14
				will be in this tag's history.

Basically, the first tag contains only the source code, and no generated
files.  The second tag (tar.bz2) contains the source code and all
generated files.  And the third tag (orig) contains all of tar.bz2
*except* the debian/ directory.  They are arranged so all history
merges back into the main non-generated source development tree.
