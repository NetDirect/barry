- Building Debian package:
	- use existing orig tarball if possible
	- git archive --prefix=barry-0.18.3/ v0.18.3-7 > something.tar
	- cd empty_work_dir
	- tar xvf something.tar
	- cp orig.tar.gz .
	- dpkg-source -b barry-0.18.3
	- test build:
		- dpkg-source -x *dsc
		- cd barry-*
		- dpkg-buildpackage -b
		- run lintian (see below)
	- debsign -kB6C2250E barry_0.18.3-7.dsc
- tests in following order:
	- run 'make update-po' periodically in each po directory to
		update translation work
	- test ABI / API and bump major or minor version as appropriate
	- run tests under test/
	- starting from a fresh sid base, test build-deps, build debian
		packages, and run sid lintian (only sid, since overrides
		in Barry are specific to sid):
		lintian --info --display-info --pedantic --color auto \
			*.changes *.deb *.dsc
	- double check hardening on sid:
		hardening-check tmp/usr/bin/barrydesktop
		hardening-check tmp/usr/lib/libbarry.so.18
		- between both, should show all options enabled
	- run binary-meta release build test (remember that chroot builds
		need a password, so run them first if running a batch)
- write release notes, including contributors, known issues, new
	features and bugs fixed
	- include mention of distros that support Barry:
		(see AUTHORS file for distro list)
	- include description at the top of what Barry is
- web docs:
	- update known issues list
	- check that all external links work, and point to proper content
	- upload latest web docs to netdirect project page
		- run: ./static.sh netdirect
	- upload latest doxygen docs to netdirect project page
- snip this version's git shortlog history into its own file
- sign-tag Barry git repo and binary-meta git repo with latest version
- no need to run maintainer/tagged-release.sh since you're maintainer now
- manually push git tags to repo.or.cz and sourceforge.net
- create binary-meta tree under dists/, and debian source packages and tarballs,
	including binary-meta tarball, under sources/
	./make-apt.sh bmbuild
	./make-yum.sh bmbuild
	./make-slimdist.sh bmbuild
- upload above tree to SourceForge
	ssh -x -a -2 -t USER,PROJECT@shell.sourceforge.net create
	   then use sf-help for details
	MAKE SURE that the tar source files are under
		/files/barry/barry-{version}/barry_{version}.tar.gz,
		so that debian/watch remains accurate
- upload binary packaging metadata to download.barry.netdirect.ca
	under a versioned directory (eg. barry-0.18.0/) and update the
	barry-latest symlink
	- remember to run make-redirect.sh for both the new release dir
		and barry-latest symlink
		For example:
		./make-redirect.sh bmbuild /barry-0.18.3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/barry/files/barry/barry-0.18.3/bmbuild
		./make-redirect.sh bmbuild /barry-latest http://sourceforge.net/projects/barry/files/barry/barry-0.18.3/bmbuild
	- add the new release to .htaccess, and replace barry-latest
		redirect links with the new ones
	- make backup of new htaccess in your local release directory
- send announcement to devel and announce mailing list, including:
	- release notes
	- shortlog
	- URLs to sourceforge and OpenSUSE Build Service binary packages
	- URL to netdirect doc page
	- send email notice to intrigeri including:
		- name of upstream tag (i.e. barry-0.18.3-2)
		- example of upstream diff
			git log -p barry-0.18.3..barry-0.18.3-2
		- release URL directly to the .dsc file
- submit tracker news item at SourceForge
- update Freshmeat entry
- update Sourceforge screenshots / icons if applicable
- update source project, bumping revision numbers in source code
