- bump version numbers in:
	- configure.ac
	- src/Makefile.am
	- src/version.cc
	- gui/src/BackupWindow.cc (about dialog)
	- src/Doxygen
	- rpm/barry*.spec
	- debian/changelog
	- opensync.../barry_sync.cc
- checkout pure CVS and test building everything
- checkout pure CVS and:
	- ./buildgen.sh in root
	- ./buildgen.sh in opensync-plugin
	- ./buildgen.sh in gui
	- remove all autom4te.cache directories
- tar, and release

Future considerations:
	- update library's doxygen developer reference on main site,
		either http://barry.sourceforge.net/ or
		http://www.netdirect.ca/...somewhere/barry-docs/
	- update binary packages for each release:
		- libbarry (deb and rpm)
		- libbarry-dev.deb and libbarry-devel.rpm
		- libbarry-doc (deb and rpm) (doxygen tree docs, same as above
			website)
		- barry (or barry-tools?)
			(command line tools, including bcharge)
			(deb and rpm)
		- barry-backup (GUI backup tool, deb and rpm)
		- barry-opensync-plugin (deb and rpm)
	- how many systems do we support?
		- depends on g++ available on each platform, and which
			compiler the supporting libs are compiled with
			- for example, if gtkmm is compiled with g++-3.3,
				barry and barry-backup should be too
		- systems:
			- debian stable (sarge at the moment, but new stable
				is coming)
			- fedora 4(?), 5, 6
				- need to check the compiler ABI's to reduce
					the number of packages needed
			- ubuntu
				- only if debian stable packages don't work by
					default on both
