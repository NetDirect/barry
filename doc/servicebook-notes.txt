The UserID is now confirmed to be an index value into the SQL database.  This
value directly corresponds to the ID field in the UserConfig table on the
BesMGNT database.

More later - the UserConfig table appears to be the big one - where the crypt
keys are kept amongst other things.  Digging deeper...

Not sure at this point.  Possibly crypt related.  Just reporting what
is on the
screen of my 7290.

Probably related to the user id index on the BES server.  UserID on the
service
book page is a straight forward integer.

Is your test device registered with a BES server or with BB's internet
service?

Even more on the 0xa field...

On my BES server, with probably 2-3 exceptions, all users have this same value
in bytes 4-12 of the CurrentKey field.

A capabilities field perchance?

More on the significance of the 0xc data type (it's nice to have access
to a BES
server, with credentials to the SQL database...)

In the BesMGMT database, in the UserConfig table, there is a column (type
varbinary[72]) called CurrentKey.  The value in the 0xc data type corresponds
directly to bytes 4 through 12 of this CurrentKey value.

Data type 0xa3 is listed on the handheld as "UserID" - this value directly
corresponds to the "ID" index value in the UserConfig table of the BesMGMT
database on the BES server.
