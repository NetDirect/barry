A list of common issues when working with Barry:
------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	When I run btool, it hangs for 30 seconds and then times out on the
	USB read call.

A:	From reports on the mailing list, this appears most likely to be
	a bug in the BlackBerry firmware.  Sometimes upgrading your
	Blackberry will fix this issue.

	This is not conclusive, and may be a kernel issue as well.

	To verify that you are experiencing the right issue, run
	"btool -vl" to get a verbose USB log.  At the beginning
	the USB configuration and endpoint information is printed.
	If the last set of endpoints have 0's in the values, you are
	experiencing the problem.  The proper set of endpoints will not
	be displayed with "lsusb -v" in this case either.

	One workaround is to run bcharge twice like this:

		bcharge
		bcharge -o

	After the second bcharge, btool should work normally.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	I'm running Ubuntu Feisty Fawn and bcharge appears to work, but
	then the charge icon goes out.

A:	This is a known problem, and unfortunately the real solution has
	not yet been found.  You might try compiling your own kernel,
	or upgrading to a different kernel.  Keep an eye on the Barry
	mailing list for the latest developments.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	I've installed Barry, and bcharge is set to run automatically,
	but as soon as I plug my device into the USB port, the device
	reboots.

A:	This is a bug in the udev script, which causes the bcharge program
	to be run 7 to 10 times back to back.  This confuses the BlackBerry
	enough to reset it.  As of 2007/07/28, there is a corrected
	udev script example in Barry CVS.  This corrected script
	will be included in the Barry 0.8 release.

	Alternative issue: You may have the berry_charge kernel module
	running, in which case you need to choose which method you wish
	to use.  Do not run both berry_charge and bcharge.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	btool is giving me errors, saying it can't find my device, or
	can't access it!

A:	If you have one of the newer BlackBerry devices, such as the Pearl
	or the Curve, these devices default to USB Mass Storage mode
	when you first plug them in.  The Linux kernel detects this,
	and on most systems loads the usb_storage module automatically,
	sometimes mounting the device as a drive.

	As only one program can control a USB device at once, you must
	remove this module before btool can find your BlackBerry.

	Run as root:     rmmod usb_storage

	Alternately, you can setup your system to run bcharge with the -o
	command line switch.  This will disable USB Mass Storage on
	your BlackBerry until the next time you plug it in, and
	without USB Mass Storage, usb_storage won't load.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	One of the Barry applications crashed, and now I keep getting
	a Desktop error message in hex.

A:	If a Barry application crashes, that means the Desktop mode was
	not shutdown properly.  Your device will likely appear to still
	be "busy" as well.  Currently the only way to fix this is to
	reset the device, either by unplugging/replugging it, or by
	running the program "breset".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	Everytime I restore a backup with the backup GUI, the database
	I need does not get restored.  What gives?

A:	Both the backup and the restore are filtered based on your
	configuration.  Check your Edit | Config... settings and make
	sure the needed database is turned on in both backup and restore.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q:	I ran the backup, but can't find my backup files!  Where did they go?

A:	The backup program saves all backup files as gzip'd tarballs
	under your home directory:  ~/.barry/backup/<pin>/
	Each backup session creates a new file, named with the
	pin number, date, and time.
