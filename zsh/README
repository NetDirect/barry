Barry ZSH autocompletion
========================

If you use ZSH and you wish that ZSH is able to autocomplete the barry
command lines, you have to add the files :
	_bjavaloader
	_btool
into the directory :
	/usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix

You can also add into your $HOME a new directory :
	$HOME/.zsh/completions
then add this path at the $FPATH environment variable : 
	export $FPATH=$PATH:$HOME/.zsh/completions
