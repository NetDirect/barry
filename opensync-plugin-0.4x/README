Development note: this plugin is in flux, not only from pure development,
	but also because the OpenSync libraries themselves are getting
	close to releasing version 0.4x, which changes some internals
	from 0.22.  This plugin is currently based on 0.4x, but that may
	change in the future.

Introduction:
-------------
This directory contains a plugin for the OpenSync framework, which can
be used to synchronize between handhelds and desktop management software,
such as Evolution and Mozilla Sunbird.

Please note that this plugin has the potential to not only change the
data in your Blackberry handheld, but also, through sending sync ADD,
MODIFY and DELETE changes, can change the data in your address book
and calendar in your desktop software of choice.  As this plugin is
in development, please exercise caution, and make backups of your
Blackberry (see the ../gui directory) *and* backups of your desktop
software's data.


You can find more information on the OpenSync framework, as well
as tarballs for the version 0.4x library and plugins, at the following
website:

	http://www.opensync.org/



Library Dependencies:
---------------------

You will need the following packages installed on your system, including
any dev or devel packages that come along with them.

	pkg-config		Used by the configure scripts
	libopensync-0.4x	OpenSync framework library
	sqlite			Required by OpenSync
	glib2			Required by OpenSync
	libxml2			Required by OpenSync
	libbarry 0.x		In the same tarball as this code.
	libusb			Required by libbarry

In addition to libopensync, you will need a plugin for your desktop
software of choice, or for other handheld devices, such as the Palm.
Please see the OpenSync website for a list of available plugins.

If you've installed Barry or OpenSync in a non-standard spot, use something
like the following:

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/cdfrey/Barry/lib/pkgconfig:/home/cdfrey/software/lib/pkgconfig"
	./configure --prefix=/home/cdfrey/Barry



Installation:
-------------

	cd opensync-plugin
	./configure

		(pkg-config will be used to find required libraries...
		make sure they are installed in standard locations,
		or that PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set appropriately)

	make
	su
	make install


Please report any bugs you find to the Barry mailing list.

Thanks!
