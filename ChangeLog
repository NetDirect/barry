Release: version 0.8 - 2007/05/??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2007/06/28
	- minor adjustment to ctags building in buildgen.sh
	- applied patch from Brian Edginton for better boost detection
		in configure.ac
	- added boost usage message to btool -h output
	- applied email MessageRecord patch from Brian Edginton (thanks!)
2007/06/21
	- more porting of OpenSync module to 0.30
	- added ctags build for opensync source tree to buildgen.sh
2007/06/14
	- changed PKG_CONFIG_PATH setting in rpm script, so that systems
		like SuSE that have an extensive PKG_CONFIG_PATH
		in general use will not break on build
	- added PKG_CONFIG_PATH to debian script too, just in case :-)
	- added debian/changelog to doc/ReleaseChecklist.txt
	- added comment to rpm/barry.spec regarding SuSE RPM builds
2007/06/08
	- applied patch from Niels de Vos fixing debian package build
		dependency
	- applied Brian Edginton's Saved Email Messages patch
	- updated r_saved_messages.cc comment to match header
	- added GetRecType()/GetUniqueId() to r_saved_messages.h, since
		SetIds() is already there
	- removed Address version of operator<<() from message related headers
		and moved into record.h
	- added std::hex to message related dumps, and changed output to
		be more mbox-like
	- updated doc/CodingStyle.txt to cover switch() statements
	- opensync compiles again, with 0.30!  (not functional yet)
		- moving closer to more modular and reusable plugin functions
	- updated release checklist for opensync version number
2007/06/07
	- added doc/CodingStyle.txt... preliminary version
2007/06/06
	- applied Brian Edginton's PIN message patch
	- changes to PIN message patch:
		- fixed missing backslash in src/Makefile.am
		- fixed tab alignment throughout
		- removed typedef from Address struct
		- added clear() to Address... might as well, if it it is
			going to be a standalone type
		- fixed missing comma in PINMessageFieldLinks table
		- changed MessageRecordId in PINMessage to load from a new
			uint32_t field in CommonField, instead of piggy
			backing on a field for other use
	- did some testing and found that PINMessage's MessageRecordId
		is the same as the RecordId given through the SetIds()
		API... but these Id's are duplicated in the protocol...
		RecordId is stored in the protocol header, while
		MessageRecordId is stored in the record it self as
		a common field... added RecType and RecordId to
		PIN Message so that we store both of these
	- updated AUTHORS
2007/05/27
	- added item to gui/TODO
	- applied Brian Edginton's s11n-boost.h patch

		- reformatted the code to match coding style
			(come on Brian) :-)
		- added copyright notice
		- changed class to singular (Memo, not Memos)
		- placed in Barry namespace
		- added #ifdef header protectors
		- added new files to Makefile.am
		- added new r_*.h headers to record.h

	- updated AUTHORS
2007/05/24
	- added ctags generation to buildgen.sh
	- applied record.{h,cc} fix patch from Brian Edginton
		- ClassFlag
		- FreeBusyFlag
		- Clear() fixes
	- fixed broken formatting in above patch
	- refactored record parser classes into separate files for each
	- changed the ConvertHtoB<> template to inline, as it caused
		linker errors with the new file layout
2007/05/17
	- fixed bug in Debian packaging that put util commands in
		/bin and /sbin instead of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
	- commited byteswap.h replacement code from gm2net
	- backup gui:
		- removed unneeded debug messages on stdout
		- changed the default for debug output to "off"
			and added a command line option to turn
			it on if necessary  (--debug-output)
		- command line option --help now also works
	- fixed bug in Calendar class where it didn't initialize
		RecType properly... and cleaned up other RecType
		code to use the GetDefaultRecType() functions,
		localizing the constants in one place
2007/05/11
	- applied patches from Brian Edginton, parsing more
		fields in Contact and Calendar records

	- updated udev/10-blackberry.rules.Debian for Debian Etch
	- updated debian/rules to use new udev rules file
	- removed debian/postinst, as stable versions of Debian now
		have a recent udev, and don't need the special handling
	- updated Debian build scripts to build separate packages:
		libbarry
		libbarry-dev
		barry-util
		barrybackup-gui
	- added menu support to Debian barrybackup-gui package
	- made the buttons bigger in the backup GUI, as they were too
		small on Debian Etch
	- opensync plugin:
		- more progress in porting to opensync 0.30, heavily
			based on the example plugin in the opensync
			svn tree...  this is a work in progress, and so far
			is incomplete
2007/05/04
	- opensync plugin:
		- partial porting to opensync 0.30 (in progress!)
		- fixed bug in sync_done where it reported context error
			and then success afterward

	- added pppob to rpm barry.spec
	- bumped release number in barry.spec
2007/04/30
	- opensync plugin:
		- fixed size check bugs (strlen() == 0 when empty)
		- finished refactoring calendar conversion routines
		- started timezone parsing, but this may go away
			if we use opensync 0.30's time functions and
			xml data format...
		- added development note to README
2007/04/29
	- updated README and opensync-plugin/README with more current
		build instructions
	- opensync plugin:
		- refactored some calendar conversion routines
		- added Barry->vCalendar conversion for recurring appointments
2007/04/27
	- opensync module:
		- removed some unneeded trace logs
		- fixed VEventConverter constructor bug, with uninitialized
			m_Data pointer
		- eased up the requirement that every calendar event
			must have a summary... defaults to "<blank subject>"
			if empty
		- added more VCALENDAR fields to match Barry::Calendar record
		- fixed case sensitive compares in vformat.c
2007/04/26
	- opensync module work:
		- added id map class to map string uid's from OpenSync to
			numeric ID's from the Blackberry
		- fixed bug in CommitChange() where it was still using
			a hard coded calendar record state table
		- added lots of logging throughout
		- fixed bug where newly added records didn't use the
			change object's uid, but created a new ID,
			causing another sync on the next run
			i.e. (CommitData_t was missing an argument)
		- fixed bug where uninitialized notification time was
			written to the Blackberry
	- more opensync module work:
		- refactored the environment class into another subclass
			called DatabaseSyncState, and moved some stand-
			alone functions from barry_sync.cc into
			the environment classes
		- added a tagged constructor to the trace class
		- fixed idmap::Load() to clear map before loading
2007/04/20
	- renamed barry-config to barry-sync, the default configuration
		file for the opensync module... and filled it with
		a sample configuration
	- added code to update the calendar cache, and write it to disk
		on success (opensync module)
	- added code to clear dirty flags in the device (opensync module)
	- allowed comments in the config file
	- added vformat.c from libopensync 0.22, since the vformat
		routines are not available from the plugin side
2007/04/19
	- updated gui/TODO
	- added -d switch to bcharge to switch back from 0001 to 0004 mode,
		changed the auto-detection logic to ignore iProduct and
		only use idProduct, and updated man page
	- updated breset to recognize the Pearl in 00004 mode as well
	- changed src/probe.cc logic to assume that the second endpoint
		pair is the one needed for database communication, instead
		of doing a reverse search from the end... newer Pearls
		in Dual mode seem to have at least 3 or 4 endpoint pairs,
		and the old search didn't always work
	- applied sourceforge patch #1696884 from Peter Silva, updating
		the Debian build for Etch, and including all files in one deb
	- added Peter Silva to AUTHORS file
	- uncommented the "make distclean" in debian/rules, and removed
		the reliance on /tmp when installing 99-barry-perms.rules
	- applied bb_task_format.txt patch from Peter Silva
	- fixed each misspelling of "recurrance" to "recurrence"
	- tweaked src/probe.cc again for paranoia's sake... start at
		offset 1 if more than 1 endpoint pair, otherwise start
		search at 0
	- split up opensync module into multiple source files, and started
		using the opensync vformat routines for parsing and building
		the vevent20 data (experimental)
2007/04/04
	- more incremental work on the opensync plugin, adding ADDED
		and MODIFIED functionality... (experimental!)
2007/03/30
	- added code to dump extra descriptors during device discovery,
		if found
	- bumped opensync version number in configure.ac, and made
		the configure scripts more consistent with the rest
		of the project
	- fixed printf-format size bug in opensync module
2007/03/29
	- applied patch from Niels de Vos, fixing deb udev rules for Pearl
	- updated AUTHORS
	- fixed extra space bug in LDIF output (added space when creating
		FullName, even if there was no last name)
	- fixed Address Book record parsing in Contact class... the
		Blackberry database uses field id 0x20 for both the
		first and last names, and if only a last name exists,
		the first name will be empty.  Fixed parser to handle
		this special case, without relying on string length.
		Thanks to Troy Engel for reporting above two LDIF bugs.
	- added a few more constants to bcharge.cc
	- renamed opensync's configure.in to configure.ac
2007/03/17
	- fixed bcharge to avoid endless reset loop... oops
2007/03/16
	- reorganized bcharge.cc to make it possible to switch between
		Pearl modes 0004 and 0001
	- added flag to BadPassword exception class, to signal whether
		the library considers the device "out of retries" or not
	- updated socket.cc for new BadPassword exception
	- added special case to Controller class destructor to reset the
		device if being destroyed in a half-open state... this is
		a temporary fix until we understand how to handle
		the "already open" message we get when opening the Desktop
		in some cases
	- added password prompt dialog to the backup GUI
	- fixed possible memory leak in GUI's DeviceInterface::Connect()
2007/03/08
	- committed Troy Engel's bbrules_mass_symlinks.patch, fixing
		udev rules for the Pearl
	- updated 10-blackberry.rules.Debian to match 10-blackberry.rules's
		functionality
	- applied Troy Engel's barry.spec patch to generate all required
		RPM's... Thank you!  Notes in the README taken from
		the sourceforge tracker entry containing the patch.
	- added libusb lib flags to tools/ and examples/ makefiles,
		and tweaked configure.ac with a better default,
		to build cleanly on RHEL 4
	- modified rpm/barry.spec:
		- does not create doc-only barry base package anymore
		- fixed "barry-backup" typo
		- removed the patch step, as version 0.7 shouldn't need it
		- added license file to each package
		- commented out console perms scripts, pending mailing list
			discussion
	- updated AUTHORS
	- applied Troy Engel's barry.spec patch to fix RHEL4 compile issues
	- fixed 80 column wrapping error in barry.spec, thanks to Troy Engel
		for the bug report
	- applied Troy Engel's udev permissions patch for Redhat/Fedora
		systems, which automatically set the ownership of a
		newly plugged in device to the currently logged in console
		user.
	- added udev/README to document what all those files are for...
		part of the text comes from the sourceforge comment
		on the above udev permissions patch from Troy Engel
	- uncommented the console perms scripts for rpm/barry.spec
	- added libglademm-2.4 to gui/README's dependency list
	- made usbwrap.* calls more threadsafe
	- added Usb::Timeout exception for timeout errors
	- added preliminary UsbSerData support to library for GPRS modem
		functionality, using Rick Scott's XmBlackBerry's serdata.c
		as a guide
	- added overloaded Socket::Send() for sending without receiving
	- added preliminary pppob command line tool
2007/03/02
	- version bump in:
		- configure.ac
		- src/Makefile.am
		- src/version.cc
		- gui/src/BackupWindow.cc (about dialog)
		- src/Doxyfile
		- rpm/barry.spec
	- build system tweaks for opensync-plugin, and added a buildgen.sh
		for it
	- added better debug messages in probe.cc and usbwrap.cc's
		device discovery code
	- changed error handling for null interface->altsetting pointers
		when doing device discovery in usbwrap.cc.  Seems that
		some devices report a higher number in bNumInterfaces
		than are really available... in this case, let's
		just ignore the missing data and assume success
	- applied udev script patch #1663986 from Troy Engel
	- applied barry-bcharge.spec patch #1672178 from Troy Engel
	- ReleaseChecklist update
	- added rpm/README based on Troy Engel's patch notes
	- updated new barry-bcharge.spec for version 0.7, removing patch
		dependency

Release: version 0.6 - 2007/02/28
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2007/02/28
	- fixed size checks for device database records larger than 64K
		Thanks to Michael Brown for the bug report.
	- added initial release maintainer scripts
	- fixed odd backup success message in GUI when doing a backup with
		no databases selected in configuration
		Thanks to Michael Brown for the bug report.
	- added udev permissions file patch from Michael Brown
	- added Michael Brown to AUTHORS
	- updated README, gui/README, and doc/USB-capture.txt
	- added -o command line switch to bcharge.cc, and updated man page
2007/02/23
	- changed library behaviour so it only turns on libusb debug output
		if in data dump mode.  In btool, -v controls this output.
	- minor stream formatting fix in btool
	- added OpenSSL dependency to build for password hash support
	- made debug dout() output conditional on Init() flag... In btool,
		-v now controls this as well
	- reverse engineered more of the initial probe packets, and
		implemented probing in struct based code... changes include:
		- added support for "attribute fetch" packets, used at
			the beginning of USB conversations
		- defined object/attribute id codes for the PIN number
		- made Protocol::SocketCommand more robust, and implemented
			its sequence number behaviour
		- moved ModeSelectCommand into SocketCommand, as it is a
			socket 0 level command
		- added initial protocol struct: PasswordChallenge
		- renamed Barry::Packet to DBPacket
		- added ZeroPacket for socket 0 packet creation and analysis
		- Barry::Packet is now the base class for the above
		- implemented socket 0 behaviour in socket.cc
		- changed return values for Send/Receive/Packet/NextRecord
			members in the Socket class from bool to void, as they
			don't generate errors themselves, but only can
			have an error if Usb::Device throws an exception.
			Cleaned up all code that called these members as well.
		- removed "last status" from Socket class as it was unused
		- updated probe.cc to use new socket 0 implementation
		- removed two of the hard coded packet handshakes in favour
			of socket 0 packets
		- updated controller.cc:
			- uses new socket 0 implementation
			- removed "flag" hack when opening sockets and
				selecting modes, as it should use the
				socket 0 sequence number
	- added initial, incomplete prototype header for the C API
	- updated some .cvsignore files
	- updated TODO
	- updated ReleaseChecklist.txt, adding rpm spec file
	- added the following to ZeroPacket:
		- ChallengeSeed()
		- RemainingTries()
		- SocketResponse()
		- SocketSqeuence()
	- moved Command() to base Packet class
	- added comments to protostructs.h and size constants for the
		new PasswordChallenge struct
	- added password support to Socket and Controller classes
		Thanks to Rick Scott's XmBlackBerry for the openssl
		password hashing logic.
	- updated btool to use new password support, and updated its man page
2007/02/22
	- updated Doxygen input files and version, and added to ReleaseChecklist
	- fixed btool PIN output for LDIF mode, now commented in output
	- major LDIF overhaul:
		- split LDIF specific code out of the record class and
			into its own
		- fixed "full name" behaviour that added an extra space
			in dn attributes, as reported by Troy Engel
		- added support for mapping of LDIF attributes to Barry
			contact field names
		- fixed base64 handling, so attributes are only so encoded
			if necessary
		- fixed base64 attribute reading inconsistency... some
			notes fields were missed in old version if not
			encoded
		- added support for specifying alternate attribute for
			constructing a FQDN, instead of just "cn"
		- updated btool and upldif to use new features
	- large update to btool manpage
	- fixed initialization bug in Contact constructor (missed RecType)
2007/02/15
	- added ktrans.cc to make reading of kernel usbfs_snoop logs easier
	- removed commented code from translate.cc
	- added Pearl handshake support to bcharge.cc, which resets the
		Pearl so that the vendor specific 0xFF class exists.
		This should allow use of btool on the Pearl.
	- added Data::AppendHexString to data.cc
	- added better probing support for the Pearl, so it detects the
		Product ID 0x0004 mode, and does a search for class 0xFF
		instead of hardcoding it.
2007/02/10
	- applied README patch from Ian Darwin
	- minor tweaks to README
	- added missing errno.h header in src/usbwrap.cc for AMD64
		Thanks to Jonathan Hudson for reporting the bug.
	- tightened up size checks in Data::ReleaseBuffer()
	- stable libusb *does* return the actual length of the USB packet...
		fixed this in usbwrap.cc to set the actual size of read data,
		and removed the size hacks elsewhere in the code:
		probe.cc, protocol.cc, socket.cc, usbwrap.cc
2007/02/09
	- added proper return codes for error conditions in btool.cc
	- clarified some stream output code in the library, for hex/dec numbers
	- removed old, non-working connect.cc test program
	- added iomanip to debug.h
	- changed usbwrap to call libusb again if EINTR and EAGAIN
		This should fix one of the OpenBSD issues
2007/02/04
	- updated AUTHORS
	- fixed bug in barrybackup GUI that didn't create the target path
		if the user didn't do Edit | Config first.
		Thanks to Ian Darwin for reporting the bug.
	- applied gui/src/ConfigFile.cc header fix patch for OpenBSD
		from Ian Darwin
2007/02/03
	- added initial btool.1 man page from Ian Darwin
	- updated man/Makefile.am for new btool.1
	- updated AUTHORS
	- applied btool -h help clarification patch from Ian Darwin
2007/02/02
	- reworked exception hierarchy, so applications can handle all
		Barry related exceptions, including Usb errors, with
		one base class: Barry::Error
	- fixed all the ripple changes this caused throughout the codebase
	- added BadPassword exception
2007/02/01
	- version bump in:
		- configure.ac
		- src/Makefile.am
		- src/version.cc
		- gui/src/BackupWindow.cc (about dialog)
	- updated doc/ReleaseChecklist.txt
	- added usb-level breset.cc command line tool
	- fixed bug in gui/src/tarfile.* for systems where
		sizeof(int) != sizeof(void*)
		- TarFile class now uses a plugin style for the compression
			operations, to allow for threadsafe versions if needed
			in the future.
		- also fixed leaked file handle bug in open_compressed()
		- Thanks to Jonathan Hudson for reporting this for 64bit systems
	- minor signed comparison fixes in the library
	- added better protocol data dumping code in probe.cc
	- added Usb::Device::BulkDrain(), to prevent Barry from hanging
		due to pending reads

Release: version 0.5 - 2007/01/26
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2007/01/26
	- added missing errno.h header to gui/src/util.cc
	- lots more endian fixes after testing on iMac  
	- iostream output size fixes
	- added option to btool to reset the device via software
	- beefed up exception handling in barrybackup
	- checked in opensync work-in-progress: trace logging, pointer bugfix
		this is still experimental
	- added aboutdialog.* files from gtkmm24 2.10.6, so we have a dialog
		class for systems running older versions of gtkmm, like
		Debian stable
	- uncommented the about box menu handler
	- added "cleanall" option to root buildgen.sh script
	- update ReleaseChecklist.txt
	- removed CVS auto-history strings from aboutdialog.*
2007/01/25
	- found a link between the unknown field in tagged protocol headers
		and the unknown field in RecordStateTable entries.  This
		field matters when uploading certain databases, such as
		Browser Options.  It is unknown what this field really
		means, but we're calling it RecType.  Updated the API
		to use this in all parser objects and builder objects
		and record objects that use it.
	- changed some uses of uint64_t to uint32_t, in Contact and
		Calendar record objects... unique IDs only seem to be
		32 bits
	- added new static function to record classes: GetDefaultRecType()
		This returns the default rectype that should work
		for that record.  Ideally this should be retrieved from
		the device, but in the case where a database has no
		records, this info would be good to know.
	- updated convenience template function Controller::AddRecordByType()
		to use GetDefaultRecType()
	- documented the recurrence data and how to use it in Calendar objects
	- added data debug output for incoming USB packets in the
		socket class... when we ported to the stable libusb
		we lost some of the verbose output... this should get it
		back.  (In the official release, you need to uncomment
		ddout() in debug.h for the full blast of debug output).
	- backup GUI updates:
		- changed error_done signal into a pure error signal,
			and changed the logic so the restore continues
			even if there was a protocol error on one database
		- changed status bar messages to show what's happening
			i.e. Backup or Restore
		- default to not restore the "Handheld Agent" database as
			it appears to be read-only on the device
		- added temporary Restore & Backup mode for debugging
		- added extra hyphen to backup files to show date/time better
		- updated GUI to save and restore the new RecType field
			supported now by the library
2007/01/21
	- added future considerations to doc/ReleaseChecklist.txt
	- applied big endian patch from Jonathan Hudson
	- changes to patch:
		- removed endian.h include from barry.h, since applications
			using the library should not care about endianness
		- hard coded the path to config.h in endian.h
			so that endian.h never makes it into the final
			install
		- removed DEFAULT_INCLUDES setting from src/Makefile.am
			for the same reason
		- removed config.h dependency in btool.cc and used library
			Version call instead
	- added big/little endian text to the Barry::Version call
	- updated AUTHORS
	- fixed install location of bcharge when building with ./configure;
		now goes to sbin/ for both source compile and binary packages
		Thanks to Jonathan Hudson for reporting this bug.
2007/01/20
	- added smarter timeout values to controller, and allowed
		timeout overrides in the packet, socket, and usbwrap code...
		extra timeouts are needed for erasing databases for
		some older devices
	- added an explicit DataDumpParser class to btool.cc, as the
		library doesn't always have extreme verbose debugging on...
		this makes sure anyone can always get raw database packets
		through btool, for development
	- added thread callback signals for error finishes and erase_db
		operations, so the GUI is updated properly
	- more GUI cleanups (status bar updates, etc)
	- finished implementation of GUI restore
	- fixed gtkmm/glibmm exception handling when the exceptions
		occur in sigc signal handlers... in that case,
		exceptions need to be handled with
		Glib::add_exception_handler()
	- added filename-only reading support to TarFile class
	- added pending gui/TODO items
2007/01/19
	- backup GUI now properly shows progress
	- the buttons become insensitive when backup is busy
	- refactored directory check code, and added mkdir check
		when to the backup setup (so the directory exists
		when we try to write to it)
	- updated code to use Barry::Data in new namespace
2007/01/18
	- moved Data class into Barry namespace
2007/01/13
	- updated copyright dates for the new year
	- clarified exception message in controller.cc
	- fixed pointer initialization bug in controller.cc
	- added documentation comments to parser.h and builder.h
	- updated ReleaseChecklist.txt
	- updated README
	- changed Barry library configure scripts to make better
		use of pkg-config for autodetecting dependencies
	- added initial Barry Backup GUI (gui/ directory), capable of making
		backups only at this point
2007/01/11
	- added doc/ReleaseChecklist.txt
	- added version API, returning version number and string
	- added Troy Engel to AUTHORS
	- added special case to bcharge.cc for the Blackberry Pearl,
		which doesn't reset itself after the charge handshake
		Thanks to Troy Engel for testing.
2007/01/05
	- added pkg-config support for the library (libbarry-0.pc.in)
	- fixed compile error on g++ 3.3 systems (missing stdint.h
		in probe.h)
	- fixed protocol hang at end of Controller operation... in
		controller destructor, it was deleting the USB interface
		before closing the socket at the BlackBerry level, thereby
		leaving the device in Desktop mode
2007/01/04
	- support the newer udev packages on Ubuntu, which need slightly
		different rules
	- modified bcharge.cc to search for Pearl devices too.
		USB product ID 6
	- added Pearl product ID to probe code, but likely not functional
		yet until we find someone able to get a USB capture for us

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2006/12/29
	- added bcharge.cc to the tools/ directory (whoohoo!)
	- added initial release version of rpm/barry.spec (aka bcharge.spec)
		This begins the barry binary release, currently only
		including the bcharge utility, but possibly more in
		the future.  Future binary packages will likely include
		libbarry, libbarry-devel, etc, which barry will then
		depend on.

	- added debian/ directory for building deb packages, with initial
		package scripts
	- added rpm/make-rpm-tarball.sh for building RPMs
	- split out technical docs into separate libbarry.docs file for
		a future Debian install
	- added more cleaning to buildgen.sh
	- added new udev rule file for Debian stable
	- hardcoded g++ to 3.3 in debian/rules as I have multiple versions
		on my system and need to compile releases with stable
2006/12/21
	- ported Barry to use the stable branch of libusb
		NOTE: no longer depends on the devel libusb tarball!
			Just use your distro's libusb packages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2006/10/12
	- fixed casting error in opensync module

2006/09/29
	- added stdint.h to parser.h for uint32_t.  Thanks Ron Gage for
		the bug report
2006/09/08
	- large refactoring of the packet parsing and building code,
		splitting the code into 3 groups:
		- record: handles record specific parsing and building...
			this is mostly subfields with CommonField structs
			as their headers, but sometimes has a specific
			header of its own, in the case of email
			Note: email's header is as yet undecoded.
			Record does not know the details of the packet
			formats, only the formats of its own record data.
		- packet: handles building of complete command packets
			and handles parsing of commonly used header values,
			providing an API for it... packet does not know
			the record format details, but does know the
			details of each Database Operation (protocol.h)
			packet format.
			So far, it seems that there is a real separation
			of operation formats and record formats, with the
			record formats being the same even with different
			database operation codes (GET_RECORDS /
			OLD_GET_RECORDS), which was not confirmed before.
			See the header size of the email record after
			refactoring.
		- controller: handles device state, and the management of
			sockets, commands, and checking for response values.
			The Controller object does not know the format
			of either the record or the packet it is sending,
			but does know the protocol handshake logic used
			to talk to the device.
	- implemented SetRecord (SET_RECORD_BY_INDEX)... syncing, here
		we come!
	- spelling correction in opensync-plugin/AUTHORS
2006/09/01
	- added sample hotplug scripts
	- added .cvsignore files for doxygen and opensync directories
	- added src/endian.h... still need to add configure support to
		handle non-little-endian machines
	- added exception handler in opensync plugin commit_change()
	- removed the device reset code in probe.cc, as resetting a device
		can renumber the devices in /proc on kernel 2.4.x,
		and cause a failure to reach the device...
		FIXME - this should be changed someday to reset if probing
		fails, and restart the probe on reset, as sometimes
		the blackberry devices respond differently when not reset
		Ideally, the probe protocol should be properly reverse
		engineered.
	- added support for retrieving record state table, which is needed
		for smarter syncing
	- added support for retrieving, deleting, and clearing the dirty
		flags of individual blackberry device records
	- added endian macros throughout the code
2006/07/13
	- added opensync-plugin to root Makefile's clean
	- updated time conversion calls to match opensync's latest SVN
	- added opensync_change_set_changetype() (only add for now,
		for development)
	- removed slow sync functions for now
2006/07/07
	- added quick "install" makefile target, to src/install by default
	- added static library target... this is temporary until autoconf
		stuff is added properly... needed for the opensync plugin
	- documented in comments that Barry::BError is intended to be
		the base classes for all exceptions
	- added first round of implementation of an opensync plugin, based
		on the example plugin code from the opensync sources

		- old and new description
		- DSID
		- bes domain / domain
	- date change in legal.txt
	- added initial parsing of ServiceBook field 0x09, and calling it
		ServiceBookConfig for now, for lack of a better name
	- added parsing for ServiceBook field 0x02 on 72xx Blackberries...
		seems to be a name or description, but doesn't appear
		in the device's own GUI... called "Hidden Name" for now
2006/06/09
	- added ServiceBook record class and parser code, based on some
		of Ron Gage's reverse engineering... code is by Chris Frey
	- added AUTHORS file
	- fixed the libusb set_configuration/claim_interface order
		bug in controller.{h,cc}... already fixed in probe,
		but not controller.  Thanks Ron Gage for finding this.

2005/12/23
	- fixed packing bug in new upload header struct
	- renamed CommonField union from data to u to be consistent
	- added return_code field to DBAccess struct, for error checking
	- added response checking during upload: if response is non-zero
		throw exception in controller.cc
	- added sorting operators to record parser classes... when writing
		contact data to the device, it may be important to write
		group link items last, since they reference other contacts...
		This needs to be tested, and if not required, removed.
	- added GROUP_FLAG field code to Contact parser class
	- fixed offset bug in Contact and Calendar Build() functions

		properly serialized
	- fixed variable name but in RecordBuilder template
	- added -f switch to btool, for saving and loading of record data

	- Contact record.h class now saves unknown Group Link field,
		for later saving
2005/12/07

		optimize away protocol struct casts
		see: 
		http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25235
		http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2003/08/11/0001.html

			02a2a3cc?hl=en#5714701b02a2a3cc
	- changed headers so that any low level protocol-specific sizes and
		structs are completely hidden in the library...
		this adds library-only header: protostructs.h

2005/11/19
	- added parser.{h,cc} virtual wrapper to generalize LoadDatabase()
	- added code to socket.cc's Packet() command to re-receive on
		reception of empty packets... this seems to be a signal
		from the device that it needs more time for long transfers

		Observed maximum blank count: 1
	- added MessageRecord and OldMessageRecord to protocol.h
	- changed common record field structs to one CommonField struct
	- increased default USB timeout to 10 seconds (some loaded devices
		seem to need more time...)
	- reorganized record.{h,cc} to try to reduce the code duplication
	- record.h classes now "know" the sizes of their corresponding
		protocol structs... this may cause trouble down the line
		with Python, if used(?)

	- removed the "Get*" database functions and replaced with
		general LoadDatabase() call, which loads any database
		available, and parses it with a Parser object

	- added -t and -d command line options to btool
	- added base64 routines from John Walker / Fourmilab and Citadel/UX
	- converted base64 routines into an API, instead of hardcoded
		file based
2005/11/18

	- renamed sbcommon.* to common.*
	- increased USB default timeout to 2 seconds

		the Cassis spec more closely
	- fixed the hardcoded offsets in blackberry.cc's protocol parsing

		destructors
2005/11/17
	- added Doxyfile to the project
	- tuned Makefile
	- added mode selection support to Blackberry class (RIM Desktop,
		RIM Bypass, and RIM_JavaLoader)

		Blackberry class, and CommandTable record class
	- added Database database parsing and protocol support
		Blackberry class and DatabaseDatabase record class
	- added Address book retrieval support - dumps data to stdout for now
	- fixed bug in CopyOnWrite mode in Data class, where could allocate
		less buffer than data copied
	- added "easy exception" debug output macro
	- fixed minor spelling error in protocol.cc
	- fixed ModeSelectCommand protocol structure - it is not a parameter
		command, but uses the unknown slots for socket and flag
		data
	- removed hardcoded socket numbers from protocol.h
	- fixed bug in socket.cc:Open() where packet size was not properly
		saved
	- implemented socket::Close()
	- fixed sequence number checks, so it is reset properly on socket 0
	- added Socket::NextRecord() for multiple record data transfers
	- fixed input handling bug in translate.cc
2005/11/11
	- added .cvsignore files to project
	- added README notes to document the source architecture
	- added dbsetup data script, which shows how to get into database
		mode, using the RIM Desktop mode, and open a socket

	- added blackberry test code in bbtool.cc - debugging the initial
		opening protocol: sockets, modes, etc... see dbsetup for
		results
	- added copy-on-write functionality to Data class, so it can be used
		with plain data buffers with little performance impact
	- added eout() and ddout() debugging - to separate:
		- regular debug output
		- exception debug output (should probably be logged to
			syslog someday, and never turned off)
		- raw data dump output
	- changed errno SBError exception handler to try to decode the error
		numbers into english (limited success)
	- fixed probe and socket USB Bulk message handling, so they don't
		use PollCompletions(), but use IO::Wait() (libusb_io_wait())
	- added common packet size checker in protocol.cc
	- fixed unpacked protocol packet structs... using gcc's
		__attribute__ ((packed)) ... see protocol.h
	- added ModeSelectCommand structure (protocol.h)
	- finished Socket::Open() call  (Close() not yet implemented)
	- moved Socket::Send/Receive() out of private, as they can be used
		for socket 0 operations.
	- cleaned up pointer management with macros:
		MAKE_PACKET()
		COMMAND()
		IS_COMMAND()
	- added IO::Wait() and IO::Cancel() to correspond with libusb API
	- added datadumping in usbwrap for easy protocol capture
	- added preliminary record.{h,cc} classes
	- added Contact record parsing, and test code
2005/10/20
