Barry is primarily intended to be a library, for any application to
access Blackberry devices.  There will be an OpenSync module built
on top of this, plus some command line utilities, and possibly a GUI,
but initially Barry is a library, and must be versioned accordingly.

Additional applications built on top of Barry may be versioned separately.

Most operating systems can handle two library version numbers: major.minor.
They use these numbers to determine which library is compatible
and most recent.

Therefore Barry will be versioned the same way, the major version
number indicating a backward incompatible change to the library.

Alpha development will occur on major version 0, incrementing the
minor version only until stability is reached.  This version will be
declared stable, a new development branch will be started with major
version 1, and patches to stable will increment its minor number.

Development will then continue on odd numbered major versions with incompatible
changes allowed.  When stable, version 1.x will become 2.0, and the
3.x branch will be opened.

Due to limitations in remaining portable across as many operating systems
as possible, Barry will discontinue its 3-number version scheme as of
version 0.4.
