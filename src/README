This directory has source code to 6 libraries.

Take a look at the Makefile.am file to see which files belong to which
library.

The file prefixes j_* and dp_* have some connection to this split.

The prefixes r_* and m_* do not: they mark files related to database
record parsing and protocol modes respectively.
