	\section getting_started Getting Started

	Welcome to the Barry reference manual.  This entire manual was
	generated via Doxygen from comments in the code.  You can view
	the code here as well, in the Files section.

	The best place to get started at the moment is to examine the
	source code to the Barry command line tool: btool.cc


	\section classes Major Classes

	To get started with the API, see the Barry::Controller class.
