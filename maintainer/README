Most of the build or test build scripts in this directory assume a system
with a number of chroot installs, in the directory /var/chroot.

The top level scripts are:

	release.sh - builds all tar, deb, and rpm packages
	test.sh    - does simple makes on all testable systems, and
		     prompts after each so you can examine the output

If using git, use:

	tagged-release.sh - Run above release.sh first to flush out any
		bugs, and if successful, tag the tree and start over with
		this script, which also updates the git repo with official
		tarball data.
