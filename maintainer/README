Most of the build or test build scripts in this directory assume a system
with a number of chroot installs, in the directory /var/chroot.

The file ~/.barrychroots is a shell script containing commands for each
chroot system you wish to build for.  The format of the commands is:

	./type.sh directory tag
	
For example, it might contain a list like this:

	export CHROOTUSER=cdfrey
	./rpm.sh /var/chroot/fedora13 f13
	./deb.sh /var/chroot/ubuntu1004 ubuntu1004

In release mode, this would build Fedora 13 packages in the fedora13
chroot system, and tag all resulting binary packages with "f13".
It would also use the /home/cdfrey directory for building.
Then it would do the same on the ubuntu 10.04 chroot system.

The top level scripts are:

	release.sh - builds all tar, deb, and rpm packages
	test.sh    - does simple makes on all testable systems, and
		     prompts after each so you can examine the output

If using git, use:

	tagged-release.sh - Run above release.sh first to flush out any
		bugs, and if successful, tag the tree and start over with
		this script, which also updates the git repo with official
		tarball data.


Miscellaneous scripts:

	ppa_build.sh - used by Martin Owens for the PPA snapshots
