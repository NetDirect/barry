Most of the build or test build scripts in this directory assume a system
with a number of chroot installs, in the directory /var/chroot.

The files:

	barrychroots
	barrylocal
	barryremote

... are scripts that are called by release.sh.  These scripts call
one or more of save.sh, remote.sh, chroot.sh, make-deb.sh, or make-rpm.sh,
in order to do the building.  These scripts can be chained together to
do the builds in the required places.

The top level scripts are:

	release.sh - builds all tar, deb, and rpm packages


Binary-meta
-----------

To build binary meta, first create a tarball with 'make tarball' in
binary-meta itself.

Then run release-bm.sh with that tarball for each target script you with
to release.

Then run make-apt.sh and make-yum.sh to turn the tree into repositories.

Run make-redirect.sh to create an .htaccess file if any HTTP redirects are
required for your setup.  And run make-slimdist.sh to grab the metadata
you need on the redirecting server.


Caution! Parallel builds:
-------------------------
It is safe to build multiple targets at the same time, but ONLY in the
same set.  For example, you can build barrychroots and barrylocal at
the same time, but not barrychroots and bmchroots together.

This is because the chroot and make-*.sh scripts use some hardcoded
directories, and moreover the RPM builds use the same ~/rpmbuild
spaces in each target, and spec files may get overwritten.
