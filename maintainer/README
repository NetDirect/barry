Most of the build or test build scripts in this directory assume a system
with a number of chroot installs, in the directory /var/chroot.

The files:

	barrychroots
	barrylocal
	barryremote

... are scripts that are called by release.sh.  These scripts call
one or more of save.sh, remote.sh, chroot.sh, make-deb.sh, or make-rpm.sh,
in order to do the building.  These scripts can be chained together to
do the builds in the required places.

The top level scripts are:

	release.sh - builds all tar, deb, and rpm packages
