This directory contains support files for ABI compatibility checking
using the tool found at:

	http://ispras.linuxfoundation.org/index.php/ABI_compliance_checker

There are two scritps:

	abi-prepare.sh - extracts a git commit or tag into /tmp and builds
			and installs it
	configure-lib.sh - support script used by *abi-prepare.sh scripts

For example, to prepare version 0.16 and 0.17.0 for comparison, run:

	./abi-prepare.sh barry-0.16 0.16.xml ./configure-lib.sh
	./abi-prepare.sh barry-0.17.0 0.17.0.xml ./configure-lib.sh

To compare, run:

	abi-compliance-checker.pl -l barry -d1 0.16.xml -d2 0.17.0.xml

Note that there are other libraries in Barry that may also need to be
checked: libbarry, libbarrydp, libbarryjdwp, libbarrybackup, etc.
